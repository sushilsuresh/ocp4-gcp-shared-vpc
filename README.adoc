You need to have an Organisation setup in your GCP account, to be able to setup
and use link:https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/shared-vpc[Shared VPC] networks.
do check the linked documentation for the same. The documentation is going to

setup but no projects or shared VPCs. In realily as consultant you will be
walking into a environment where all of this prereqs are already in place.
